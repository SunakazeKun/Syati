/*
* A simple custom actor to help you get started with the game's LiveActor system. This actor functions as described:
* - It is invisible and uses no model.
* - It can appear through SW_APPEAR, however, this is not necessary.
* - It uses a single sensor to interact with other objects, specifically the player.
* - The sensor's radius can be specified using Obj_arg0.
* - The sensor forcibly pushes the player away, preventing them from going *inside* the sensor.
* - When the sensor is attacked with a Spin Attack by the player or the Orange Luma, the actor gets killed.
